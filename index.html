    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This website demonstrates what I have learned in Java since I have started programming in it.
      This website shows the homemade elements I have used various times in my projects. I wish to
      share this knowledge in the form of this website to help anyone who may need it. These classes
      and methods can become very useful if you use them correctly and in the right places.
      <br /><br />
      In <i>Java's Swing Library</i>, I show the basics of using the <span class="code">java.awt</span>
      abstract library, as well as its forerunning and non-abstract library, <span class="code">javax.swing</span>.
      <br /><br />
      In <i>KeyChecker</i>, I show the uses of my custom-made class <span class="code">KeyChecker</span>,
      which extends <span class="code">java.awt.event.KeyAdapter</span>. This class is used to detect key
      inputs from a <span class="code">java.awt.Component</span> and to provide a basic method for checking
      if a key is pressed according to this Component.
      <br /><br />
      In <i>Hitboxes</i>, I show how to detect collision with hitboxes and how to relate them to on-screen
      elements.
      <br /><br />
      In <i>Acceleration</i>, I show how acceleration can be performed visually, as well as the proper way to
      make a project sleep (interrupt the thread for a set time).
      <br /><br />
      In <i>Rotating Labels</i> or <i>RJLabels</i>, I show how you can procedurally rotate a <span class="code">javax.swing.JLabel</span>
      (or really any AWT Component), and how to override methods, add in your own code, and call the previous
      method as a result.
      <br /><br />
      In <i>Directional Movement</i>, I can show how you can use <span class="code">Math.sin()</span> and <span class="code">Math.cos()</span>
      to convert an integer value responsible for resembling a direction in degrees into two separate values, one
      for X movement, and the other for Y movement. I will also show how to convert these values back into a single
      value with <span class="code">Math.atan2()</span>.
