    <h3>Summary</h3>
    <p>
      Java's Swing library is used to create an interactible interface for the user, rather than a basic text-based
      one, or none at all. From windows and text to buttons and sliders, the Swing library is a good pick for programmers'
      needs when it comes to creating a visual interface for their programs.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Figure #1: A basic Swing window setup.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p>
      Here is an example of a Swing window. There are several aspects to it; the text, the buttons, the scroll bar, and the
      window itself. These are all elements that can be found within the Swing library, under <span class="code">JFrame</span>,
      <span class="code">JLabel</span>, <span class="code">JButton</span>, <span class="code">JScrollBar</span>, and
      <span class="code">JToolBar</span>. <span class="code">ImageIcon</span> and <span class="code">BorderFactory</span>
      can also be found here.
    </p>
    <h3>The AWT Class</h3>
    <!-- Put an image here -->
    <p class="brief">
      The majority (if not all) of Swing's classes and methods come the AWT (Abstract Window Toolkit) class. The AWT class
      contains many visual interface related content, not unlike Swing. However, AWT's classes are abstract, and are meant
      to be modified in one way or another. <span class="code">Frame</span>, <span class="code">Window</span>,
      <span class="code">Label</span>, and <span class="code">Image</span> are all abstract classes within the AWT library.
      <span class="code">java.applet</span> is another library that takes use of AWT's contents. However, unlike Swing, Applet
      uses AWT alongside other functions instead of completely basing itself off of it or recreating it.
    </p>

    <h3>JComponents & JContainers</h3>
    <!-- Put an image here -->
    <p class="brief">
      Swing consists of <span class="code">JComponent</span> objects and <span class="code">JContainer</span> objects.
      <span class="code">JComponent</span> objects have their own designated purposes, while <span class="code">JContainer</span>
      objects, while they also have their own respective uses, are meant to contain <span class="code">JComponent</span>
      objects or other <span class="code">JContainer</span> objects.
    </p>
    <figure>
      <img href="images/swing/#" alt="A visual demonstration of how JContainers work. Describe..." />
      <figcaption>Figure #3: A visual demonstration of how JContainers work.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <p class="brief">
      Here is an example of how JContainers work. They can contain <span class="code">JComponent</span> objects and
      <span class="code">JContainer</span> objects alike. They can be added with the <span class="code">add()</span>
      methods and revoked with the <span class="code">remove()</span> commands.
    </p>
    <h3>JFrames, JLabels, and JPanels</h3>
    <!-- Put an image here -->
    <p class="brief">
      <span class="code">JFrame</span>, <span class="code">JLabel</span>, and <span class="code">JPanel</span> objects
      are extensions of either the <span class="code">JComponent</span> class or the <span class="code">JContainer</span>
      class. Since <span class="code">JFrame</span> and <span class="code">JPanel</span> objects can contain other
      components, they are subclasses of the <span class="code">JContainer</span> class. Since
      <span class="code">JLabel</span> cannot, it is simply a subclass of the <span class="code">JComponent</span> class.
      These three Swing components are the most commonly used of the three. <span class="code">JFrame</span> is used to
      create windows/frames, <span class="code">JLabel</span> is used to create elements of text or images, and
      <span class="code">JPanel</span> is used to catagorize and separate components from each other, not unlike the
      <span class="code">&lt;div&gt;</span> HTML element.
    </p>

      <figcaption>Figure #4: Here are all of the mentioned elements in use.</figcaption>
    </figure>
    <h3>More Swing Elements</h3>
    <!-- Put an image here -->
    <p class="brief">
      The <span class="code">JButton</span>, <span class="code">JScrollPane</span>, <span class="code">JLayeredPane</span>,
      and <span class="code">JToolBar</span> classes are more Swing components that are less commonly used, but still used
      regardless. In visual interfaces, these are used very often. Swing interfaces can easily be compared to HTML. For
      example, a <span class="code">JButton</span> can be compared to the <span class="code">&lt;button&gt;</span> tag in
      HTML. <span class="code">JLabel</span> with <span class="code">&lt;label&gt;</span>. <span class="code">JTextField</span>
      with <span class="code">&lt;textfield&gt;</span>, and many more. In fact, Swing components, specifically
      <span class="code">JLabel</span>, can support HTML text. If you were to type something like
      <span class="code">new JLabel("&lt;html&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Important text&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/html&gt;");</span>,
      you would get <b><u>Important text</u></b> as a result. Regardless, Swing and HTML have some similarities, so you could
      find some Swing components similar to HTML tags.
